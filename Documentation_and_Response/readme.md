# Project Response and Documentation Guidelines

In addition to the actual devising, creation, build, and presentation of each project, you also need create documentation of your project along with a project paper.

This serves a number of purposes.

1. This encourages you to capture/document your project throughout the entire process.
2. This allows you the opportunity to create a set of deliverables that could be shared with others interested in your work (colleagues, peers, critics, galleries, etc.).
3. This process will require to reflect upon your work throughout the process, and at the end. This reflection will lead to individual and group insights, that will inevitably feedback into future iterations or projects.
4. It is critical that you learn how to discuss and present your work through written documents and videos. As you will be asked to do this constantly as a professional artist or creative.


## Documentation

Throughout the entire devising, development, iteration, build, and presentation processes you should document your project and work. This will necessarily compromise multiple forms, including, but not limited to;

- images/photos
- sketches
- mocke-ups
- mind-maps
- progress reflections
- artistic/aesthetic reflections
- pilot studies
- code snippets
- commit messages
- videos
