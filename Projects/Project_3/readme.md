# Project 3 -- Class Collective builds an Interactive Art Installation

GRADE: 30% of your final grade



- **Public Presentation: _Interactive Arts Show; December 3rd_**
- **Critique: _December 5TH_**
- Sketch reviews: _Week 10; Wednesday, October 31st_

For the final project, the class will work in 1 or 2 collectives (depending on size) to build a large final installation project.

This piece should explore issues of interactive theory through an immersive art installation.

I will serve as project manager (PM) for the collective. However, I will not influence ideas or artistic direction. I will simply work to help keep the group on track, take care of logistics, and manage internal deadlines.

The collective will be required to coalesce around a single artistic idea. Flowing from this, the group will self-assign roles/tasks over the course of the project.

## Initial Ideation

Initial project ideas and sketches will be completed individually. These will then be presented and discussed by the entire group. Individual ideas will serve as the seeds of a larger idea, which will be hashed out in-class.

## Install

The install of the work will occur the last week of classes, leading up to the Interactive Arts Show.

## Public Presentation

The work will be open to the public the entire day of the Interactive Arts Show. Students will need to take a "shift" watching the work.

## Critique

The formal critique will occur the morning of the Media Arts Expo.

## Strike

Strike will occur in the morning the day following the Media Arts Expo.

## Collective Documentation

Like previous projects, the group will be responsible for submitting a single set of documentation about the art work. This is to be completed collaboratively.

*Unlike* previous projects, documentation is due at the time of critique. This means that documentation footage, editing, and writing will need to occur simultaneously with install and presentation.

## Individual Documentation

For this project, you also need to submit a brief (1-page) document describing your work towards the final project. This document should also include a discussion of what knowledge, technical skills, and/or artistic skills you acquired.
