Project title: Naturally Distributed

The focus of this installation piece is meant to invoke a sense of being in three different environments through sound, video, and light. The project is meant to show the relationship between technology and the natural world. By making the participant feel as though they are experiencing certain environments through technology the goal is to make them question their sense of reality. The motion of the participant changes the environment to give even more of a sense of movement through the piece.

Project Title: Social MediArt

Social MediArt is an exploration of the way the general population now views art, especially in a gallery setting. The goal of this project was to make the participant consider how they interact with art, and how we often view art now through the lens of technology and social media.

For this project we chose to use Near Field Communication or NFC tags, the same technology used for things like Apple Pay, where the proximity of the phone to a sensor triggers an action on the phone itself. While NFC functions are locked on iPhones, a user can enable NFC on Android phones. Using NFC tags, we created a small mock art gallery that is interactive with a participant through the use of an NFC enabled phone. While exploring the gallery, a participant’s phone would be prompted by NFC tags to do things like send a tweet, text a friend, take a picture, or open a video in relation to the art piece they are observing.
