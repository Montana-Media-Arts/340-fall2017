# Working with Processing towards OpenCV

Processing allows for many additional libraries to be integrated into its workflow.

## Video Lib

One library you may find useful for Processing allows you to easily work with Videos. This includes web cam video and file-based video. To do this, you will need to add the Video Library to your Processing environment, as well as into you sketch.

To add a library in Processing, you need to open the "Contribution Manager". To easily do this, go to "Sketch" → "Import Library" → "Add Library..."
